# govflowai

AI-powered workflow automation engine for government and public sector document triage, classification, and routing.

## 🌐 Live Infrastructure & Deployment

- **Frontend Application:** [https://civic-ai-gray.vercel.app](https://civic-ai-gray.vercel.app)
- **Database Engine:** Managed PostgreSQL on [Railway](https://railway.com) (Driver-level SSL Enforced)
- **Healthcheck Endpoint:** `GET /health` (Returns `200 OK`)

---

## ⚡ Technical Architecture

- **Cryptographic Audit Trail:** Hash-chain audit log where each document state is chained to prevent post-hoc tampering.
- **Strict Data Isolation:** Enforced TLS connections (`sslmode=require`) at driver layer for compliance.
- **Low-Latency Ingestion:** Optimized for high-throughput PII redaction and document triage.
